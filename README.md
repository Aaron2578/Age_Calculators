# CodeAlpha_Age-Calculator
In this project, I designed and implemented a user-friendly web application where users can input their date of birth in the format DD-MM-YYYY. 
Upon clicking the 'calculate' button, the system skillfully processes the data and presents the user's age in the format of DD-MM-YYYY. 
This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in web development but also highlights my ability to handle data processing and presentation in a user-centric manner.
